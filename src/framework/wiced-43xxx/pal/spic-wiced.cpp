/**
 * @brief Constructor of the WICED SPIC class
 *
 * This function is setting the basics for a SPIC and the default
 * spi on Arduino which is implemented as WICED_SPI_0 by patching the following:
 *
 * - \<WICED_SDK\>/platforms/\<platform_name\>/platform.h
 *   add WICED_SPI_0, to the wiced_spi_t
 * - \<WICED_SDK\>/platforms/\<platform_name\>/platform.c
 *   add the following to the platform_spi_peripherals
 *   [WICED_SPI_0]  =
 *      {
 *          .port                    = BCM4390X_SPI_0,
 *          .pin_mosi                = &platform_gpio_pins[WICED_GPIO_6],
 *          .pin_miso                = &platform_gpio_pins[WICED_GPIO_8],
 *          .pin_clock               = &platform_gpio_pins[WICED_GPIO_5],

 *          .driver                  = &spi_bb_driver,
 *      },
 *    which sets the Arduino header GPIOs and the bit banging driver.
