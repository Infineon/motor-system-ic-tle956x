Adaptive Gate Control (AGC)
---------------------------
The Infineonâ€™s Motor System ICs (TLE956x) and Multi MOSFET driver ICs (TLE9210x) include a MOSFET driver with multi-stage current source gate control which is configured over SPI. Over this interface, the turn-on (tDONx) and turn-off (tDOFFx) delay can be controlled in PWM operation, as well as the rise (tRISEx) and fall (tFALLx) times. Therefore the algorithms explained in `Rise fall time regulation with current source MOSFET gate drivers`_ were implemented in this library.

Example codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two software examples available, that directly execute the regulation like shown in the animated GIF.

	* **TLE9562_DCM_rise-and-fall-time-regulation.ino** for use with DC motors
	* **TLE9563_BLDCM_rise-and-fall-time-regulation.ino** for use with BLDC motors

For optimal results it's recommended to use **TLE9562_DCM_rise-and-fall-time-regulation.ino** with an ideal R-L- Load instead of a real motor to avoid side effects. 
This code can be used on both TLE956x boards despite the specific name. 

Parameter defines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to constantly change the initial charge current (ICHG) / initial discharge current (IDCHG) go to **TLE9xxx.hpp**.
